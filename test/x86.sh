# Description:
#
# This script performs integration testing of the GDB 'exploitable' plugin
# for x86 targets. It is designed to be executed from the base directory
# of the 'exploitable' project, though another directory may be specified
# via the TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR environment variable. It isn't pretty, but it is
# designed to work both locally and with travis-ci.org VMs.
#
# Functional overview: 
#
# This script downloads test dependencies and builds the test
# cases supplied in the exploitable repo. The script then runs triage.py 
# over all of the test cases in the and stores the result to a JSON file.
# Finally, the result is compared to an expected result.

set -x # this script is not polished/user-friendly, so we debug by default
